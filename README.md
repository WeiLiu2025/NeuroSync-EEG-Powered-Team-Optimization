# Exploring the Impact of Emotional States on Teamwork Effectiveness in Interprofessional Education Using EEG Data

## Overview
This project investigates how emotional states influence teamwork effectiveness in **Interprofessional Education (IPE)** through the use of **EEG data**. Traditional IPE approaches often struggle with scalability, inclusivity, and real-world applicability. To address these challenges, we introduce a **novel computational framework** integrating:

1. **Collaborative Interprofessional Learning Network (CILN)** – A system incorporating learner embeddings, knowledge fusion, and collaborative optimization to enhance interdisciplinary collaboration.
2. **Dynamic Interaction Strategy (DIS)** – A method leveraging adaptive interaction modeling, feedback-driven refinement, and temporal evolution to optimize team interactions.

Our approach significantly improves **interdisciplinary understanding, task performance, and adaptability** in teamwork scenarios.

## Key Features
- **EEG-based Emotional State Analysis** – Utilizing EEG data to assess emotional influences on teamwork.
- **Adaptive Learning Mechanisms** – Scalable and diversity-preserving interprofessional collaboration.
- **Real-Time Interaction Optimization** – Dynamic feedback and temporal evolution for sustained teamwork effectiveness.
- **Experimental Validation** – Demonstrating superiority over traditional IPE methods through empirical testing.
